## Projects Overview

This repository contains projects completed and built by myself at [42](https://www.42.fr/), a coding university. Each project demonstrates different skills and knowledge in various programming languages and technologies.

### Project List
0. [**C-Piscine/Reloaded**]
    - **Language**: C
    - **Description**: Reviewing most functions and exercises done in the Piscine (a probationary time at the school before starting the core curriculum).
                        Getting familiar with shell and C and the norminette system which emphasizes clean coding habits.

1. [**libft**]
    - **Language**: C
    - **Description**: Re-code useful C functions like split or join using only `malloc`, `free`, and `write`.
    - Bonus includes functions working with data structures such as linked lists. Continually expanded..
2. [**born2beroot**]
    - **Language**: Unix
    - **Description**: Create a virtual machine under specific instructions. Setting up a minimal Debian server implementing strict rules such as strong password policy, UFW firewall, SSH, etc. A Bash script is provided in the repository that had to be broadcasted to all users every 10 minutes using crontab and wall.

3. [**get_next_line**]
    - **Language**: C
    - **Description**: Write a function which returns a line read from a file descriptor.

4. [**ft_printf**]
    - **Language**: C
    - **Description**: Reproduce basic functioning of the printf function with certain flags implemented: `%c`, `%s`, `%i`, `%d`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%p`, `%%`.


5. [**FdF**]
    - **Language**: C
    - **Description**: FdF (Fil de Fer) is a graphical project aiming to create a simple 3D wireframe renderer. The project's objective is to read a map file containing coordinates and heights and generate a graphical representation of the terrain.

6. [**fract-ol**]
    - **Language**: C
    - **Description**: Develop a fractal exploration program that renders various fractals such as the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets. The project involves creating interactive graphics that allow users to zoom and pan across the fractals, enhancing understanding of complex mathematical structures through visual representation.
