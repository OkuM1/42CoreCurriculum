    - **Description**: Create a virtual machine under specific instructions. Setting up a minimal Debian server implementing strict rules such as strong password policy, UFW firewall, SSH, etc. A Bash script is provided in the repository that had to be broadcasted to all users every 10 minutes using crontab and wall.

3. [**get_next_line**](update)
    - **Language**: C
    - **Description**: Write a function which returns a line read from a file descriptor. Bonus includes handling multiple file descriptors without losing the reading thread on each of them.

    - **Description**: Reproduce basic functioning of the printf function with certain flags implemented: `%c`, `%s`, `%i`, `%d`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%p`, `%%`.


5. [**FdF** 🕹️](update)
    - **Language**: C
