Initialization: At the beginning of the function, several variables are initialized:

    vars->coord.zx and vars->coord.zy are set to 0, representing the initial complex number z=0z=0.
    vars->coord.xx and vars->coord.yy are set to 0, representing the squared values of the real and imaginary parts of zz, respectively.
    vars->coord.temp is set to 0, which will hold a temporary value during calculations.
    vars->coord.iter is set to 0, representing the iteration count.

Iteration: The function then enters a loop where it iterates until either the magnitude squared of the complex number zz exceeds 4 or the maximum iteration count (MAX_ITER) is reached.

Mandelbrot Set Equation: Within each iteration, it applies the Mandelbrot set iteration formula:
z←z2+c
z←z2+c

where zz is a complex number, and cc is the coordinates of a point in the complex plane (represented here as vars->coord.x_viewp and vars->coord.y_viewp).

julia constant +c 
    In the Mandelbrot set calculation, zz starts at 0 for each pixel.
    In the Julia set calculation, zz starts at the coordinates of the current pixel being evaluated.
